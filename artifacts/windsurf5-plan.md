# Tab3 Gemini Live API Integration Plan

## Notes
- Always use 'models/gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview' for tab3 (user requirement).
- The Colab implementation (LiveAPI_streaming_in_colab.py) has working real-time audio I/O and WebSocket logic.
- The current Streamlit implementation lacks robust audio streaming and error handling.
- UI/state management and error handling for audio and WebSocket are now integrated into tab3.

## OLD Task List
- [x] Review streamlit_app.py tab3 (real-time conversation) implementation
- [x] Review LiveAPI_streaming_in_colab.py for working audio/WebSocket logic
- [x] Plan stepwise integration of Colab audio streaming into Streamlit tab3
- [x] Implement audio processing (buffering, streaming, error handling) for tab3
- [x] Integrate/upgrade manage_websocket_connection to support audio streaming
- [x] Ensure UI and state management for audio and connection status
- [x] Add error handling and user feedback for audio and WebSocket errors
- [DROPPED] Test real-time audio, WebSocket stability, and error scenarios

## New Task List
- Review streamlit_app.py tab1
- Review streamlit_app.py tab3
- Think step by step how to have a multi-turn conversation, where the model asks the user for the language and word to translate. Then a user records audio saved to a file, then send to 'gemma-3-27b-it' API, and then get the response audio from the model, display the audio playback and play it back to the user.
- Then the user-model interaction should repeat until the user clicks on the stop button.
- Replace the existing tab3 implementation with the new task list above

## Current Goal
Test and verify real-time audio and WebSocket handling
