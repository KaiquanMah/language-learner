# Introduction
* **Project Title**: Language Learner - Learn a new language with our chatbot!
* **Problem we want to solve**: Build a simple web application to help people learn a new language.
* **Flowchart**
Example: User Input -> [API 1: Audio Analysis] -> Processed Data -> [API 2: Audio Generation] -> Display Text and Analysis in Streamlit

# Requirements
- Easy to use
- Engaging visuals, while prioritising accessibility for elderly and people with disabilities who may use the application
- As a user, I want the app to load immediately when I load the page, so that I can start a conversation with the chatbot immediately
- As a user, I want the app to tell me what it can do, so that I can simply know how to use the app
- As a user, I want to click a button <... pls continue...>
- <...please fill up the user stories...>
- syllabus / curriculum
- user converse with the chatbot - eg translate from english audio to target language audio, practise a few times with the chatbot, then move on to how you would respond, and practise with the chatbot
- user reads a passage in the target language out loud, then converse
- <...please fill up any other use cases...>

- Model and API integration - Use a Google xx API available out of the box
- ML pipeline - We can have a sequence of ML API operations, where the output response of an API call can be shown on the UI to the user, then used as input to subsequent API calls
- Streamlit frontend user interface, with a Python backend
